# C++ Final Project Proposal Instructions

## Course Scope
This project should demonstrate your understanding of:
- Basic variable types (int, double, char, string, bool)
- Functions (parameters, return values)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Conditionals (if, else if, else, switch)

## Proposal Requirements

Your project proposal should be 1-2 pages and include the following sections:

### 1. Project Title
Choose a clear, descriptive name for your project.

### 2. Team Members
List all team members (1-2 people recommended). If working with a partner, you must also complete the Partner Agreement below.

### 3. Project Description
Write 2-3 paragraphs describing:
- What your program will do
- Who would use it and why
- What makes it interesting or useful

### 4. Core Features
List 3-5 main features your program will include. Be specific about what the user can do.

**Example:**
- User can input their test scores and calculate their average
- Program validates that scores are between 0-100
- User can choose to calculate weighted or unweighted average

### 5. Technical Approach
Describe how you will implement your project using course concepts:
- What variables/data types will you use?
- What functions will you create? (List at least 3-4)
- What loops will you need?
- What conditional logic will you implement?

### 6. User Interaction
Explain how users will interact with your program:
- What input will they provide?
- What output will they see?
- Will there be menus or multiple options?

### 7. Timeline
Break your project into weekly milestones:
- **Week 1:** Planning and basic structure
- **Week 2:** Core functionality
- **Week 3:** Testing and refinement
- **Week 4:** Documentation and final submission

### 8. Potential Challenges
Identify 2-3 challenges you anticipate and how you might address them.

## Project Ideas (Inspiration)

- **Grade Calculator:** Input assignments, calculate final grade with different weighting
- **Number Guessing Game:** Computer generates random number, user guesses with hints
- **Budget Tracker:** Track income/expenses, calculate totals and remaining balance
- **Temperature Converter:** Convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin with validation
- **Quiz Program:** Present questions, track score, provide feedback
- **Simple Calculator:** Perform operations based on user menu selection
- **Word Counter:** Analyze text input for word count, character count, etc.
- **Loan Calculator:** Calculate monthly payments based on principal, rate, and term

## Evaluation Criteria

Your proposal will be evaluated on:
- Clarity and completeness of description
- Appropriate scope (challenging but achievable with course content)
- Thoughtful technical approach
- Realistic timeline
- Professional presentation

## Tips for Successful Partnership

1. **Communicate early and often** - Don't wait until the deadline to discuss issues
2. **Be specific about expectations** - Vague agreements lead to misunderstandings
3. **Document your work** - Keep notes on who did what and when
4. **Be flexible** - Circumstances change; be willing to adjust the agreement
5. **Respect each other's time** - Meet deadlines you set with your partner
6. **Test together** - Don't just divide and conquer; review and test as a team

Remember: A successful partnership requires effort from both members. Good communication and mutual respect are key!
